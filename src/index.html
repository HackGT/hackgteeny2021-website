              HackGTeeny is a series of six hour-and-a-half workshops for any
              Georgia Tech student who wants to learn fundamental concepts in
              CS, especially skills that apply at a hackathon. Workshops will
              happen daily at locations throughout Georgia Tech's campus from
              Monday, September 27th to Saturday, October 2nd. Each day is a new
              topic, ranging from data science to how to participate in a
              hackathon! See below for more details on our schedule and
              curriculum below.

            <p>
              We are looking for mentors for HackGTeeny! Any students or
              industry professionals who are patient, knowledgeable, and have a
              passion for at least one of the workshop topics are encouraged to
              sign up! You do not have to attend every workshop; but we'd love
              to have you as often as you'd like! You will help participants
              during the workshops to answer questions, and we will have
              training sessions and more information about how to prepare.
            </p>

                registration</strong
              >. If you already signed up for HackGT 8 as a mentor, you do not
              need to fill out the free response questions; we will pull your
              response from your HackGT 8 mentor application. If you are
              accepted as a HackGTeeny mentor you will automatically be a HackGT
              8 mentor if you indicate in the registration.

        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>
          On the registration site, you can select as many of the following
          workshops as you like. You can find a schedule of the workshops below
          under <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a>. For the four Learning Paths
          that will also be featured in more detail at HackGT 8 (App Dev, Data
          Science, Design, and Systems), each workshop will be an introduction
          to that topic, including a brief overview and some example
          applications or projects. The other two workshops (Introduction to
          Hackathons and Introduction to Development) will include information
          applicable to HackGT 8, other hackathons, and development in general
          that will be applicable throughout college and beyond! Descriptions
          for each Learning Path or workshop are below.
        </p>

        <h4>App/Web development</h4>
        <p>
          This path covers Android, iOS, and web development; you can choose as
          many of the options as you’d like! You will be introduced to the
          basics of Android app development using Android Studio or iOS
          development to build native mobile apps. We will also step through the
          entire process of creating a simple full-stack web application using
          JavaScript. Soon, you will be able to not only show off your technical
          skills but also publish your accomplishments online, on the Google
          Play store or your very own website!
        </p>

        <h4>Data Science</h4>
        <p>
          Whether you’re interested in machine learning algorithms or data
          analytics and visualization, the data science learning path will
          expose students to the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing
          large sets of data!
        </p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          The Design Learning Path will teach you the fundamentals of user
          interface/user experience (UI/UX) design from user research to
          creating beautiful mockups and prototypes. Gain skills and knowledge
          vital to the product development process and apply them to create
          effective user-centered apps and websites!
        </p>

        <h4>Systems</h4>
        <p>
          In the Systems Learning Path, we will be going over the basics of
          systems development. Specifically, we’ll be exploring robotics and
          developing embedded systems using Arduinos to create innovative
          projects that combine software and hardware!
        </p>

        <h4>Intro to Hackathons</h4>
        <p>
          New to hackathons and want to learn more about how the experience is?
          At this workshop, we’ll talk about how a hackathon works and how to
          work through the event to create a project within 36 hours! We’ll also
          highlight resources, tips, and tricks to utilize during the event!
        </p>

        <h4>Intro to Development</h4>
        <p>
          For this workshop, we’ll walk through some common technologies and
          practices that apply to personal projects and in the computer science
          industry, such as brainstorming, version control, and collaboration!
          By the end, you’ll be ready to work in a team on any project!
